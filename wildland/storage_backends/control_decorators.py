def control_directory(name):

    Decorated generator should yield 2-tuples: name (a string) and object which
    represents the directory contents. That object's class should have further
    attributes decorated with either :func:`control_file` or
    :func:`control_directory`.

    When the file is *read*, decorated function will be called without argument
    and should return the director contents (:class:`bytes`). When the file is
    *written*, the function will be called with the argument to ``write()``
    (also :class:`bytes`).
