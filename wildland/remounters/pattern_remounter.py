class PatternRemounter(Remounter):
    """
    A class for watching files and remounting if necessary.

    This works by registering watches in WL (FUSE) daemon for requested files.
    Watching files outside of WL tree is not supported (there is no direct file
    change notification - like inotify - support).
    When file change is reported, the container in question is loaded and then
    compared with mounted state (same as the ``wl container mount`` does - either
    mount it new, or remount relevant storages).

    When a Wildland Path watching is requested, it is resolved to a list of
    manifests in relevant container manifests-catalog, using
    :py:meth:`Search.get_watch_params`. If some of those containers are not mounted,
    the function returns also a list of containers to mount. Those containers are mounted
    only at "backend unique" paths (in /.users/... hierarchy) to not pollute user view.
    Then, they are monitored similarly to normal files like described above, with the difference
    that a file change event results in a Wildland path resolve again, instead of loading
    just changed file. This way, it will detect any new/removed containers if the change was to
    a container in manifests catalog like `manifest-pattern` field, or redirecting to a
    different storage.

    Currently, this class does not unmount containers from manifests catalog that are no longer
    needed (neither because of some manifest catalog change, nor because of simply
    terminating remounter).
