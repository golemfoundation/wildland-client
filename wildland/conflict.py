    (it's local filesystem, or results are cached).

    - If there are multiple directories with the same name, create a synthetic directory with this

      (i.e. the list of files cannot be modified, but the files themselves can).

      directory, the file name is changed to '{name.stem}.wl_{storage}.{name.suffix}' (with stem and
      suffix being PurePosixPath semantic).
